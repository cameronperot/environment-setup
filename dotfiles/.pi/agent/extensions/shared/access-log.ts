/**
 * The shared read-access log.
 *
 * Imported by built-in-tool-renderer.ts (guards the `read` tool) and
 * protected-paths-bash.ts (guards `bash`), so a path blocked for `read` and the
 * same path blocked for `cat` land in one file. Policy itself lives in
 * `rules.ts`; this module only records what happened.
 *
 * This directory has no index.ts and no package.json, so Pi's extension
 * discovery (extensions/*.ts and extensions/*\/index.ts, one level, no
 * recursion) does not try to load it as an extension.
