# git-commit

Create atomic, well-messaged git commits. Follow the workflow in order; never commit blind.

Trailing input after `/skill:git-commit` constrains the commit — the intended subject, scope, or subset of files (e.g. `only the config changes` → commit just the configuration files); with no input, partition and commit every change in the working tree per the workflow.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the current state before anything else: `git status`, `git diff` and `git diff --staged`, then `git log --oneline -10` — context and scope names already in use, nothing more.
2. Partition the changes into logical units: one concern per commit. A bug fix, a feature, and a rename each stand alone. Group at file level. **IF** a single file mixes unrelated concerns **THEN** flag it and ask the user how to proceed rather than attempting hunk-level surgery.
3. Stage the first unit explicitly: `git add <paths>`. Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a` — blanket staging is how secrets and junk end up in history.
4. Scan the staged diff (`git diff --staged`) before committing:
   - Secrets, tokens, keys, credentials — never commit these; stop and tell the user.
   - Leftover debug output or temporary code.
   - Large or generated files that don't belong in version control.
   - Untracked junk in `git status` → propose `.gitignore` entries instead of committing it.
5. Write the message per the format below.
6. Commit with exactly this form (keeps multi-line messages intact):

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type(scope): subject

   Body explaining what and why.
   EOF
   )"
   ```

7. Verify: `git log -1 --stat` matches the intended unit; `git status` shows what remains. Repeat steps 2–7 per unit until the tree is clean or only intentionally-uncommitted changes remain.

## Message format (Conventional Commits)

- Header: `type(scope): subject` — imperative mood, lowercase subject, no trailing period, ≤72 characters. Scope is optional; use one already present in `git log` when it fits.
- Types:

  | Type | Use for |
  |---|---|
  | `feat` | New user-facing capability |
  | `fix` | Bug fix |
  | `refactor` | Code change that alters neither behavior nor interface |
  | `perf` | Performance improvement |
  | `docs` | Documentation only |
  | `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
  | `build` | Build system or dependencies |
  | `ci` | CI configuration |
  | `chore` | Maintenance that fits none of the above |

- Body: blank line after the header, wrapped at 72 characters, explains what changed and why — never how; the diff already shows how. Omit the body only when the header says everything.
- Footer: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` for breaking changes; issue references (`Closes #123`) when applicable.

Good:

```
fix(gateway): reject bursts above 50 req/s

Prevents the exchange API key from being banned during volatile
markets. The previous limiter counted per-endpoint, so aggregate
traffic could exceed the exchange-wide cap.
```

Bad (vague type-less header, narrates the how, trailing period):

```
Fixed some rate limit stuff in the gateway by adding a counter.
```

## Hooks

- **IF** a pre-commit hook fails **THEN** fix the cause, re-stage, and retry. Never pass `--no-verify` — the hook exists to block exactly this commit.
- **IF** a hook auto-modifies files **THEN** re-stage the modified files and retry once. If it fails again, stop and show the user the hook output.

## Safety rules

- Never amend, rebase, or otherwise rewrite commits that have been pushed.
- Never add AI attribution: no `Co-Authored-By` agent trailers, no "Generated with" lines.
- This skill ends at the commit. Never push unless the user separately asks.
